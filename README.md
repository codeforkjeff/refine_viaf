**IMPORTANT!** Please use
[conciliator](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/conciliator) instead,
which does what refine_viaf does, plus more. This project is no longer
being maintained.

refine_viaf
===========

refine_viaf implements a [VIAF](http://viaf.org) (Virtual
International Authority File) Reconciliation Service for
[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org). This is used for resolving many
types of names (ie. persons, organizations, geographic regions) to
standard IDs representing those entities.

This project was rewritten in Java in Dec 2015. For more info, see
[this page](http://codefork.com/blog/index.php/2015/12/10/a-major-update-to-refine-viaf/). The
old version written in Python is no longer being maintained, but can
be found in the
[python-deprecated branch](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/refine_viaf/tree/python-deprecated).

Features
--------

* Support for the following types of names provided by VIAF: Corporate
  Names, Geographic Names, Personal Names, Works, Expressions

* "Proxy mode" to retrieve IDs used by source institutions, instead of
  VIAF IDs. (NOTE: hyperlinks to source record pages in OpenRefine are
  supported for BNE, DNB, ICCU, JPG, LC, NDL, SELIBR, SUDOC, and
  WKP. Links are BROKEN for BNC, BNF, DBC, and NUKAT. For all other
  sources, the links will take you to the VIAF page.)

* Good performance (uses threads; stable memory usage; caches results)

* Super easy to run

Public Server
-------------

If your needs are low and you can't or don't want to run this software
yourself, you can use the public server at
<http://refine.codefork.com/>. Visit that address for more
instructions.

Running the Service on Your Computer
------------------------------------

Install Java 1.7 or greater if you don't already have it.

Download the .jar file for the
[latest release](https://github.com/codeforkjeff/refine_viaf/releases). Alternatively,
you can download the source code tarball or clone this repository, and
build the .jar file using maven.

Run this command:

```
java -jar refine_viaf-1.5.2.jar
```

That's it! You should see some messages as the application starts
up. Now you're ready to configure OpenRefine to use the service. When
you're done with it, hit Ctrl-C to quit the application.

Configuring OpenRefine
----------------------

1. In OpenRefine, chose a column of names you want to reconcile, and
   select "Reconcile" and "Start Reconciling..." in the column
   pull-down menu.

2. Click "Add Standard Service..."

3. To reconcile against names from any VIAF source, type in:

    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf
    ```

    To reconcile against a specific VIAF source, append its code to
    the end of the path. For example, to search only names from the
    Biblioth√®que nationale de France, type in:
    
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viaf/BNF
    ```

    To retrieve the IDs used by source institutions, rather than VIAF
    IDs, use "proxy mode." For example, to search only names from the
    Library of Congress and retrieve their IDs, type in:
    
    ```
    http://localhost:8080/reconcile/viafproxy/LC
    ```

4. Follow the instructions on the dialog box to start reconciling
   names.

Advanced Usage
--------------

To build from the source code, install maven and type:

```
mvn package
```

If you want to host this software on a server for long-term usage or
if you want to enable logging for debugging purposes, take a look at
`run.sh` for some helpful options.

You can change several run-time options (including the service name
that appears in OpenRefine and turning caching on/off) by editing the
`refine_viaf.properties` file.
